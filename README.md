# Scheduler

This project involved making a mock scheduling application for a consulting company. 
I had to make a call to a SQL database that is unfortunately no longer accessible. 
From there I had to pull in the existing data and allow users to modify and create both
customers and appointments. I also had to make sure that users weren't able to schedule 
conflicting appointments.
